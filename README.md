# Mobile-Price-Prediction

**ðŸ“±Content:** 

The price of a cell phone, which has become a necessity in our daily lives, varies widely depending on its specifications. In this notebook, we will explore the factors that affect cell phone prices and predict new samples based on the best model.

**ðŸ“±This notebook includes the following:**

- Preprocessing
- Data cleaning
- Preparing the data to train a model
- Training and making predictions using various regression models
- Model evaluation
    
**ðŸ“±Objective:**   
    
Our objective is to predict the price of a mobile phone by building a model that takes into account various features provided in the dataset. We will be using supervised learning methods such as **Linear Regression (LR)**, **KNN Regressor** to determine the best model for this problem.

**ðŸ“”About Dataset**

Imagine you started your own mobile company. There are many big companies standing in front of you.
You don't have good knowledge about how to mark a price produced by your company. As you have a good knowledge of ML & DS you started searching for some dataset related to mobile sales for various companies and you are able to find a small dataset around it.


**ðŸ“”Problem Statement:**

The goal of this problem is to build a machine learning model to predict the price to mark for the mobiles produced by company.
